## Task
- Create a database (DB).
- In this database, create a scheme with a name that corresponds to the student's last name. All newly created objects must belong to this schema.
- Build all necessary objects (tables, primary keys, secondary keys, foreign keys, indexes, check constraints) for the specified database.
- Enter at least 10 abstract records in each database table (if the number is not limited by logic, of course).
- Create a diagram for a fully designed database. Tables should be displayed on the chart in standard mode (column name, data type, allow null) Relationships between tables should be adjusted to indicate which columns they relate to.
